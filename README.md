# Confluent Platform on Raspberry PI

This github repo shows how to build a Raspberry cluster with Confluent Platform and run a 200â‚¬ cluster with ~10-15MB/s Throughput. Confluent Platform is so to say made for RPI. With best feature set lik tiered storage and others you can really have a cheap IoT edge cluster.

Installation setup and architecture is shown in following image.

The benefits to run Confluent Platform on Raspberry PI is obviously:
* full and complete Monitoring with Confluent Control Center im Management Mode and Health+ for the Monitoring Dashboard outside the edge.
* Storage is not a problem with SDCards anymore on RPI with Tiered Storage and integration of Cloud provider Object Storage (in our case AWS S3)
* Full support of the complete Confluent Edge platform
* Adjusted project prices for Edge Subscriptions

Currently, we know 4 deployment options to deploy Confluent Platform on Raspberry PI:
* complete manual [deployment with TAR installation](tar-ball-installation/)
* complete manual deployment with some automatism (service setup etc.) with confluent packages via OS apt-get/yum repository (not covered here), please follow the [documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/installing_cp/overview.html).
* Automatic deployment via [cp-ansible](cp-ansible-installation/)
* k8s deployment with Confluent for Kubernetes and own build images (this is not covered here). Confluent do not offer ARM images right now. You have to build the container images by yourself, see [documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/docker/development.html). 
   * A partner of Confluent is having a complete package including HW, SW and images. Please visit [HiveCell: Edge PaaS for Kafka](https://hivecell.com/service/)

# Use cases for such a low cost cluster
* the main use case for such IoT edge clusters is queuing events in location where having requirement to do that (e.g. not having all time a working network, or having no IT) e.g.
  * on cruises
  * local shops
  * energy parks like Photovoltaic
* remote maintenance for expensive machines
* and others IOT use cases.


# Software
we will use the following software to run the cluster
* Ubuntu OS
* openJDK: Java 11
* Python 3
* Confluent Platform 7.1
* Confluent cli

# Hardware
We will run with Raspberry PI 4. Best would be with 8 GB RAM, but this is not easy to get today. 4GB RAM do work also quite good. I did add a buying list with links to Amazon, but please keep in mind that Amazon is selling RPI with very expensive prices, my choice of buying RPI is [berrybase](https://www.berrybase.de/). They run the same prices like before Corona:
* 4 x [Raspberry PI 4 4GB RAM](https://amzn.to/3FwZHX0) or [Raspberry PI 4 8GB RAM](https://amzn.to/3L47MDK) (Raspberry )
    * 1 x [RPI cluster buildcase](https://amzn.to/3vUVCbE)
* 1 x [USB Power Hub](https://amzn.to/3LZDmUm)
    * 4 x [USB-C Power cable](https://amzn.to/3FHU6xb)
* 1 x [unmanaged Network Router](https://amzn.to/3vUyha8)
    * 1 x [Network cable](https://amzn.to/399lb00)
* 4 x [128 GB SDCard](https://amzn.to/3wgqBhy)
* 1 x [LED light band](https://amzn.to/3Ftp6AI)
* 1 x [Power Cable](https://amzn.to/3smIaLE)
